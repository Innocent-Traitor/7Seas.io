# ShipGame
 
Originally built as a prototype to learn timelines in GameMaker Studio 2, I decided to try and flesh it out as a whole new game.
(Completely scrapping the whole timeline thing as well) I got pretty far into it,
it has a leveling system for the player, different enemy AI behaviours, randomly generated enemy stats, and prototype for a shop.
Eventually, I dropped this project as I am moving away from GameMaker Studio 2 (Great engine, poor licensing (i hate subcriptions)) for Godot 4.
I might try and recreate this in Godot for a release, but I doubt it since I've already moved onto other projects.

I do not have the executable for the game, however all the source code is here if you'd like to rebuild it in GameMaker yourself. I did have a version for the serverside code as I slowly chipped away at that with a prototype for the client version, but I never uploaded it to Github as a backup, so it is lost to the sands of time.
